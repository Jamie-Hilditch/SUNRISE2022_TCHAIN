# T-Chain Spectral Analysis

Compute estimates of $\chi$ and $\epsilon$ from temperature spectra following the method of Zhang and Moum 2010 (<https://doi.org/10.1175/2010JTECHO746.1>).
Much of this code follows Marion Alberty's MATLAB code (<https://github.com/marionalberty/ArcticBowChainAnalysis>).
